# richFacesBaseMaven
Richfaces base maven application <br/>
A project to help begginers in jsf + richaces  with maven like me that does not understand the premises that tutorial makers does when creating their tutorials. This is a simple application with all richfaces base and its dependencies and a managed bean using cdi annotations sample. No extra config in web.xml or faces-config.xml (actually no faces-config.xml were created)

The problem: The problem here relies on the fact that every tutorial about this subject is made using eclipse or dont use maven. Not mentioning the fact that almost all tutorials consider you already know something and ommit some important configuration parts.So with this little project I want to give an start to all jsf new-comers like me to know the basics of creating a jsf project with richfaces and a managed bean using cdi and everything coded in bare hands in gedit

Ps: I'm not saying that is wrong use eclipse or any tool to boost the app creation, I'm just saying that if you are like me and does not like to be stucked in only one environment or only one IDE, having the ability to create the application without any tool will make you a little smarter and adaptable to various possible circunstances
