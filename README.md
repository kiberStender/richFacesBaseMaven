# richFacesBaseMaven
Richfaces base maven application
A project to help begginers in jsf + richaces  with maven like me that does not understand the premises that tutorial makers does when creating their tutorials. This is a simple application with all richfaces base and its dependencies and a managed bean using cdi annotations sample. No extra config in web.xml or conf.xml or faces-config.xml (actually no faces-config were created)

The problem: The problem here relies on the fact that every tutorial about this subject is made using eclipse or dont use maven. Not mentioning the fact that almost all tutorials consider you already know something and ommit some important configuration parts.So with this little project I want to give an start to all jsf new-comers like me to know the basics of creating a jsf project with richfaces and a managed bean using cdi
